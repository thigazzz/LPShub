# LPShub

A centralized hub designed to simplify the addition, execution, and management of local Python scripts on your computer.

## Features or Examples
- Run scripts
- Add, delete and update scripts

## Motivation
Despite efficiently organizing my small scripts on my computer, the process of navigating to the script location and executing them by entering the same two commands (to activate the virtual environment and run the script) became tedious. To address this inconvenience, I initiated this project, hoping that it could be beneficial for others facing a similar challenge.
